# DontMakeFunctionsWithinLoops
Small html file that shows the problems associated with functions in loops.  The first click me will attach
a click handler on the hello world labels.  When you click on each hello world, you will see that the result
is 3 for each elelment.  Now click on the second button.  Clicking on each label now results in what we expect,
0, 1 and 2.  This is bad because we are creating multiple functions and could result in unintended consequenses.
Clicking the last button has the same result as the previous button, but it has the function factored out of the 
for loop.
